# 🚀 Delivery Performance BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Delivery Performance BI Dashboard** provides real-time insights into delivery operations, helping the team track key performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, and optimize efficiency.

---

## 📊 Situation
The operations team lacked visibility into delivery performance due to fragmented data across multiple sources. They needed a solution to track:
- 📦 **On-time delivery rates**
- ⏱️ **Average delivery time**
- 🛵 **Driver efficiency**

**Challenge:** Data was scattered across the order management system, driver tracking, and customer feedback.

---

## 🎯 Task
✅ Build a **centralized BI dashboard** in **Looker Studio**
✅ Integrate multiple data sources
✅ Provide clear **KPIs & trends** for data-driven decision-making

---

## ⚙️ Action
🔹 **Data Extraction & Transformation:** Used **BigQuery** to extract and structure the data  
🔹 **Key Metrics Calculated:**
   - 📍 **On-time delivery rate**
   - 🕒 **Average delivery time**
   - ❌ **Late delivery flag**
🔹 **Dashboard Features:**
   - 📅 **Interactive filters** (date, country, store)
   - 📊 **Clear visualization of KPIs & trends**
🔹 **Data Accuracy:** Validated against the **source database** for reliability
